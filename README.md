# flameSimulator

This is a poor attempt at porting a flame pattern generator for an 8x8 RGB LED matrix from Arduino to the PIC16F1 platform.

It runs super fucking slow but it does run. If you find a way to eliminate floating-point usage in the code it should run well. There are lots of HSL-RGB and RGB-HSL conversion algos out there but they all use floats, argh!
